 5. Next, crosses river to Naqada
 6. Buys dagger here if dagger-less
 7. Next up, Abydos and its temple (TRAP)
 8. Goes to Thinis, finds/buys boat.

    - Furthest is Herakleopolis, least is Badari

    - Repairs boat in Beni Hasan
 11. Makes it to Herakleopolis, sees Bent Pyramid in distance and lake
 12. Needs to go around lake to continue North bound
